# shairport-sync-metadata-webserver
HTML page showing metadata from shairport-sync using forked shairport-sync-metadata-reader by birdslikewires

---

This is (supposed to be) HTML page showing metadata from shairport-sync metadata which is then outputted as a separate file, that is possible thanks to awesome @birdslikewires.
It is still WIP, but it's usable. I've only put this here for better copying between my NAS (where shairport is installed and used) and my PC.
